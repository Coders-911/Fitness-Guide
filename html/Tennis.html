                Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent (singles) or between
                two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to
                strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The
                object of the game is to manoeuvre the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid
                return. The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point, while the opposite player
                will.

                    <h5>Proper Equipment</h5>
                    You don’t need a lot to begin playing tennis. You just need a racquet and some gym clothes including
                    proper shoes. Any set of gym clothes will work for tennis, so you don’t necessarily need to spend a
                    lot of money. Tennis requires a good amount of footwork, however, so you’ll need to make sure you
                    have a decent pair of tennis shoes. Avoid running shoes as they do not provide the ankle support
                    you’ll need for rapid lateral movement.

                    <h5>Use a Ball Machine</h5>
                    Once you know the basics of the forehand and backhand stroke, you’ll want to practice, practice,
                    practice. A great way to improve your stroke is by renting a ball machine and simply practice
                    returning the balls. Listen to your instructor and use the ball machine to master what you learn.

                <li>
                    <h5>Play Regularly</h5>
                    This is key to improving in any sport or anything you want to do. Play regularly. Go to your tennis
                    lessons and then play with a partner and practice every week. Your muscles need it for conditioning
                    and muscle memory. Practice the skills you learn and you’ll see yourself improving week after week.
                    A club is a great place to do this. While you’re at it, don’t forget to have fun!
