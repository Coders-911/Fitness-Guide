                Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent (singles) or between
                two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to
                strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The
                object of the game is to manoeuvre the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid
                return. The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point, while the opposite player
                will.

            <h3>Tips on Learning to Play Tennis</h3>
            <div class="p">


                <p>
                    You may think because you didn’t play tennis as a kid or even as a teenager, it’s too late to start
                    now.
                    The truth is, you can begin playing tennis at any age, and it’s great for your physical and mental
                    health. Tennis truly is a sport you can play for a lifetime.
                    You don't need to have a massive court, an outfit and the best racket out on the market to get great
                    at
                    tennis.

            <h4>Three Tips on Learning to Play Tennis Later in Life</h4>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h5>Proper Equipment</h5>
                    <br>

                    <div class="p">
                        <p>
                            You don’t need a lot to begin playing tennis. You just need a racquet and some gym clothes
                            including
                            proper shoes. Any set of gym clothes will work for tennis, so you don’t necessarily need to
                            spend a
                            lot of money. Tennis requires a good amount of footwork, however, so you’ll need to make
                            sure you
                            have a decent pair of tennis shoes. Avoid running shoes as they do not provide the ankle
                            support
                            you’ll need for rapid lateral movement.

                    <h5>Use a Ball Machine</h5>
                    <br>

                    <div class="p">
                        <p>
                            Once you know the basics of the forehand and backhand stroke, you’ll want to practice,
                            practice,
                            practice. A great way to improve your stroke is by renting a ball machine and simply
                            practice
                            returning the balls. Listen to your instructor and use the ball machine to master what you
                            learn.

                    <h5>Play Regularly</h5>

                            This is key to improving in any sport or anything you want to do. Play regularly. Go to your
                            tennis
                            lessons and then play with a partner and practice every week. Your muscles need it for
                            conditioning
                            and muscle memory. Practice the skills you learn and you’ll see yourself improving week
                            after week.
                            A club is a great place to do this. While you’re at it, don’t forget to have fun!
