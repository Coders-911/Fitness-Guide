            <p>golf, a cross-country game in which a player strikes a small ball with various clubs from a series of
                starting points (teeing grounds) into a series of holes on a course. The player who holes his ball in
                the fewest strokes wins. The origins of the game are difficult to ascertain, although evidence now
                suggests that early forms of golf were played in the Netherlands first and then in Scotland.</p>

            <p>From a somewhat obscure antiquity, the game attained worldwide popularity, especially in the 20th
                century. Nothing is known about the early game’s favourite venues on the European continent, but in
                Scotland golf was first played on seaside links with their crisp turf and natural hazards. Only later in
                the game’s evolution did play on downs, moorland, and parkland courses begin. Golfers participate at
                every level, from a recreational game to popular televised professional tournaments. Despite its
                attractions, golf is not a game for everyone; it requires a high degree of skill that is honed only with
                great patience and dedication.</p>

            Every round of golf is based on playing a number of holes in a given order. A "round" typically consists of
            18 holes that are played in the order determined by the course layout. Each hole is played once in the round
            on a standard course of 18 holes. The game can be played by any number of people, although a typical group
            playing will have 1-4 people playing the round. The typical amount of time required for pace of play for a
            9-hole round is two hours and four hours for an 18-hole round.

            <h1>Golf Rules</h1>
            <ul class="prgrf">

                <li>The ball must be hit using standard clubs from the start of each hole to the green and ultimately
                    into the hole, which is marked by a flag.</li>
                <li>Players strike the ball in turn with the furthest away from the hole going first. At the start of a
                    new hole whoever took the least shots on the preceding hole shall go first.</li>
                <li>The penalty for a lost ball is one stroke and this includes balls struck out of bounds (off that
                    particular hole) or into water hazards. You have five minutes to search for your ball and the
                    penalty is both stroke (one shot) if the ball is lost and additionally distance (you play again from
                    your original starting point) if it goes out of bounds or into the water.</li>
                <li>Players can only use up to 14 clubs.
                </li>
                <li>Players cannot seek advice from anyone other than their partner or caddy.</li>
                <li>The ball should be played as it is found – you must not move, break or bend anything fixed or
                    growing, other than to assume your normal stance, to improve the lie of the ball, your line of site
                    or your area of swing.</li>
                <li>On the putting green a player can mark, lift and clean his ball so long as it is replaced exactly
                    where it was. He or she may also repair ball marks or hole plugs but not spike marks that are on the
                    putting line.</li>
