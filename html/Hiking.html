            <p>Hiking is a wonderful way to immerse yourself in the outdoors. Transported by your own two feet and
                carrying only what you need for the day on your back, you can discover the beauty of nature at whatever
                pace you’re comfortable with. And, with a little planning and preparation, it’s an activity that almost
                anyone can do.</p>

            <p>If you’ve dreamed of hiking, but have yet to try it, it’s time to get out there. Just follow these steps:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Find a hiking partner</li>
                <li>Choose a hike</li>
                <li>Gear up</li>
            </ol>

            <h1>Tips for Choosing a Hiking Route</h1>
            <img id="tips" src="https://www.rei.com/dam/skrobecki_092419_0729_choose_route.jpg">
            <p>Before you start your search for the perfect hike, it’s helpful to think through a few things, such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p> <span>How much time you have:</span> Do you have a couple hours or a full day? The amount of
                        time you have can determine where you go. Don’t forget to factor in how long it takes to get to
                        and from the trailhead.</p>
                </li>
                <li><span>Your fitness level:</span>Honestly assess what kind of shape you’re in. You want to have an
                    enjoyable time out there rather than suffering through a long, strenuous hike that you’re not
                    prepared for. If you’re not in the shape of your life, don’t be dismayed: There are hikes for
                    everyone.</li>
                <li><span> Distance:</span>Think about how many miles and hours you’re comfortable hiking. An average
                    walking pace is about 3 mph, but your hiking pace may be slower than that depending on terrain,
                    elevation gain and how much weight you’re carrying on your back.</li>
                <li><span>Time of year and weather:</span>Some trails won’t be accessible in early spring because
                    they’re covered in snow. If it’s fall and the sun is setting earlier, plan accordingly so you’re not
                    caught out after dark unexpectedly</li>
            </ul>
